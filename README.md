- 👋 Hi, I’m @terody
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and simple solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, because it's something I've never had to work with before.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might catch my interest, perhaps in the field of the data collection from cycling metrics and dynamics
- 📫 How to reach me...should be easy enough to figure out.
